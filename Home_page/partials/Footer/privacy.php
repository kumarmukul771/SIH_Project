								A Privacy Policy agreement is the agreement where you specify if you collect personal data from your users, what kind of personal data you collect and what you do with that data.<br><br>
This agreement is required by law if you collect personal data. Personal data is any kind of data or information that can be considered personal (identifies an individual) such as:<br><br>

<i>1.Email address</i><br>
<i>2.First and last name</i><br>
<i>3.Credit card information</i><br>
<i>4.Billing and shipping address</i><br>

<u><b style="font-size: 45px;">What is a Privacy Policy?</b></u><br><br>
A Privacy Policy is a legal statement that specifies what the business owner does with the personal data collected from users, along with how the data is processed and for what purposes.<br><br>

In 1968, Council of Europe did studies on the threat of the Internet expansion as they were concerned with the effects of technology on human rights. This lead to the development of policies that were to be developed to protect personal data.<br><br>

This marks the start of what we know now as a "Privacy Policy." While the name "Privacy Policy" refers to the legal agreement, the concept of privacy and protecting user data is closely related.<br><br>

This agreement can also be known under these names:<br>
